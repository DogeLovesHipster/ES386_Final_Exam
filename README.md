# ES386_Final_Exam
Saving my work to show the world that I think I know what R is...

This was my final exam work for my ES class teaching me about R. I think I can confidently say that I enjoy Python way more, but I still think R is pretty neat on quick data science stuff. Just thought I'd leave this repo up to show that I think I know how R works. At least enough to print hello world!
