# ES386_Final_Exam
For the ES386 Environmental Data Science class final, students had the option of completing the final using Excel or R to interpret data. Out of a class of 30+, I was the only one to choose to complete the assignment using R. So I gave this work it's own repo to show my accomplishment. Though I have a preference for Python, R has a lot of many unique and fun tools to mess around with!

## Content of Repo

- Final_Practicum_Exam_W23.pdf - The final exam PDF for the class that explained our objective of the final. This paper details the exact outline of what we need to. Feel free to reference this for my thought process of how I organized and commented my main R code.

- tidepool.csv - The final exam practice spreadsheet containing pretty simple tidepool data.

- final_exam.R - The R file that contains all my comments that explain my code and throught process alongside the main code that graphs, processes and organizes the data.
