# ES386_Final_Exam
For the ES386 Environmental Data Science class final, students had the option of completing the final using Excel or R to interpret data. Out of a class of 30+, I was the only one to choose to complete the assignment using R. So I gave this work it's own repo to show my accomplishment. Though I have a preference for Python, R has a lot of many unique and fun tools to mess around with!
